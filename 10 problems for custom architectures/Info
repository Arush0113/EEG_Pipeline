This folder has the problems given at the beginning for developing custom architectures for different tasks of NLP, Computer Vision and Time series analysis.
All the tasks have been perfoemed using the Keras API (including functional and subclassing). 
Here I have also built custom architectures with custom training loops and custom layers and models.
