All the code files for the actual project will be found in the team02 folder.
The folder "10 problems for custom architectures" contains the initial problems for developing custom Neural Network architectures for practicing on several different problems.

All the code in this repo has been written by Vineet Yadav, Sahil Maurya and Arush, all of us being pre-final year undergraduates at IIT Kanpur. We are supervised by Anmol Gupta Sir, who is a Phd candidate at IIT Roorkee, and helped greatly by Gaurav Sir, who is also a Phd candidate at IIT Roorkee.
